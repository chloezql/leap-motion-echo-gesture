# leap-motion-echo-gesture
A demo built with leap motion and echoAR API. Use leap motion gesture controll to control the display of the model. 

## Register
If you don't have an echoAR API key yet, make sure to register for FREE at [echoAR](https://console.echoar.xyz/#/auth/register).

## Setup
* [Add the 3D model](https://docs.echoar.xyz/quickstart/add-a-3d-model) from the [models](https://github.com/echoARxyz/AR.js-echoAR-COVID19/tree/master/models) folder to the console.
* Replace apikey in index.html line with your own apikey that can be found in console. 

## Run
Open the code locally on a server like MAMP or simply import all code into online platform like Glitch or Codepen to try the demo right away. Make sure hiro marker is visible to your camera. Click "Change Model" button to start the random journey. You can add or delete model in your console then reload the page to see a new pool of model. 

## Notes
 * When you use browser to try the demo make sure you use HTTPS to avoid any problem on camera accessibility. 
 * Loading Complex model or loading models the first time may cost 5-10 seconds to render. Please be patient.
 * No model is attached to the marker when you just load the demo. So it's normal when you don't see any model at the beginning. Click the "Change Model" button once to start viewing the models.
